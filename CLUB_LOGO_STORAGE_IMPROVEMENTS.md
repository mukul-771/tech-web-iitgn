# Club Logo Upload & Storage System Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Club Logo Display Enhancement**
**Problem**: Logo upload section was basic and didn't prominently show the current logo
**Solution**: Complete redesign of the LogoUpload component

#### Improvements Made:
- **Prominent Current Logo Display**: 
  - Larger logo preview (96x96px instead of 64x64px)
  - Bordered container with "Current" badge indicator
  - Professional styling with proper spacing and typography
  - Clear labeling and user guidance

- **Enhanced Upload Area**:
  - Better visual feedback with hover effects
  - More detailed upload guidelines
  - Improved drag-and-drop styling
  - Format specifications and size limits clearly displayed
  - Better responsive design

- **Technical Improvements**:
  - Fixed Next.js Image optimization warnings
  - Better error handling and user feedback
  - Improved accessibility

### 2. ✅ **"Failed to Update Club" Error Resolution**
**Problem**: Club updates were failing in production due to file-based storage limitations
**Solution**: Migrated clubs system to Vercel Blob storage with development fallback

#### Migration Implementation:
- **Created `clubs-blob-storage.ts`**:
  - Vercel Blob storage for production
  - File-based storage fallback for development
  - Automatic environment detection
  - Seamless data migration

- **Updated All API Routes**:
  - `/api/admin/clubs/[id]/route.ts` - Individual club operations
  - `/api/admin/clubs/route.ts` - Bulk club operations  
  - `/api/clubs/route.ts` - Public club listing
  - `/api/clubs/[id]/route.ts` - Public individual club data

- **Maintains Backward Compatibility**:
  - Existing club data is preserved
  - Automatic migration on first use
  - No data loss during transition

## Technical Details

### Logo Upload Component (`/components/admin/logo-upload.tsx`)
```tsx
// Before: Basic 64x64 preview with minimal styling
// After: Professional 96x96 preview with comprehensive UI

Features:
- Prominent current logo section with visual indicators
- Enhanced upload area with better UX
- Detailed format and size guidelines  
- Improved responsive design
- Better error handling and feedback
```

### Blob Storage System (`/lib/clubs-blob-storage.ts`)
```typescript
// Environment-aware storage system
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';

if (isDevelopment) {
  // Use file-based storage (data/clubs.json)
} else {
  // Use Vercel Blob storage with BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN
}
```
