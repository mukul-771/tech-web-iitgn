# Final UI Alignment Fix - Admin Panel Coordinator Cards

## Issue
The admin panel team management page was displaying coordinator cards in two rows instead of a single row on large screens, even though there were only 5 coordinators.

## Root Cause
The grid layout was using progressive breakpoints:
- `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 2xl:grid-cols-5`

This meant that at the `lg` (1024px+) and `xl` (1280px+) breakpoints, only 3-4 columns were shown, causing the 5th coordinator to wrap to a second row.

## Solution Applied
Updated the admin panel team page (`/src/app/admin/team/page.tsx`) with separate grid layouts for different categories:

### Before:
```tsx
category === "leadership" || category === "coordinator" 
  ? "md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 2xl:grid-cols-5" 
  : "md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"
```

### After:
```tsx
category === "leadership" 
  ? "gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 2xl:grid-cols-5"
  : category === "coordinator"
  ? "gap-3 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-5"
  : "gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"
```

## Changes Made
1. **Coordinator-specific grid**: `lg:grid-cols-5` ensures all 5 coordinators display in a single row at 1024px+ screens
2. **Reduced gap spacing**: Changed from `gap-4` to `gap-3` for coordinators to provide better fit
3. **Maintained leadership flexibility**: Leadership section keeps progressive breakpoints for scalability

## Result
- All 5 coordinator cards now display in a single row on screens 1024px and larger
- Admin panel layout is now consistent with the main website
- Cards maintain proper spacing and readability
- Leadership section remains flexible for future growth

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/admin/team/page.tsx` - Updated grid layout logic

## Testing
- Verified on local development server
- Pushed to GitHub for production deployment
- Changes will be reflected in next Vercel build

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
Admin panel coordinator cards now properly display all 5 members in a single row on large screens, matching the main website layout.
