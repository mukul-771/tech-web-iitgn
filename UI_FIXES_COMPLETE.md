# ‚úÖ FIXED: Team Photo Alignment & Data Visibility Issues

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Main Website Data Visibility** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Changes made in admin panel were not visible on main website
- **Root Cause**: About page was being cached by Next.js static generation
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to force server-side rendering
  - Added `export const revalidate = 0` to prevent caching
  - Added logging to track data loading

### 2. **Team Photo Alignment & Sizing** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Photos were random sizes, not properly aligned, and mismatched
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `TeamMemberImage` component to use `aspect-square` for consistent square sizing
  - Fixed grid layouts with consistent spacing (`gap-6` instead of mixed gaps)
  - Improved responsive sizing with better breakpoints
  - All photos now display as perfect squares with rounded corners

### 3. **Card Layout Consistency** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Team member cards had inconsistent spacing and alignment
- **Solution**:
  - Standardized padding (`p-4 lg:p-6`)
  - Fixed grid responsive breakpoints
  - Added `justify-items-center` for better alignment
  - Consistent margin/spacing throughout

## Technical Changes Made

### Files Updated:
1. **`src/components/ui/team-member-image.tsx`**
   - Added `aspect-square` class for consistent square photos
   - Fixed container div structure

2. **`src/app/about/page.tsx`**
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
   - Added `export const revalidate = 0`
   - Improved grid spacing and sizing classes
   - Added logging for debugging

3. **`src/app/about/council-members/page.tsx`**
   - Fixed grid layout with better spacing
   - Added `justify-items-center` for alignment
   - Consistent card sizing with `max-w-sm`
